# Open Frameworks

### Particles system over text

[Link to project](openFrameworks/particles-from-font-controlled-by-mouse)

Move the mouse to control the particles spread from their original position. Keep the button press for halo effect. Performance can (and should) be improved.


### Animated recursive Tree

[Link to project](openFrameworks/recursive-tree-animated)

You can adjust the amount of trees and the depth. Use the mouse button to rebuild them.

I compiled a web version using Emscripten [Here](https://fernandopetrelli.com/experiments/recursive-trees-and-webassembly)
